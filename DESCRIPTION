Title: R Package for Pairwise Preference Elicitation

Description: Implements the preference elicitation algorithm 
    described in "Bayesian Preference Elicitation for Engineering Design 
    Optimization", by Lepird, Owen, and Kochenderfer. This approach allows
    users to derive multiobjective weights from pairwise comparisons, which
    research shows is more repeatable, transparent, and intuitive than 
    directly defining weights.
